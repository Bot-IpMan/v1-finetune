## 1. What You Need to Grow Green Peas

To grow green peas in a grow room, gather the following materials and tools:

- **Seeds**: High-quality, disease-free pea seeds (choose a variety suited to your space).
- **Containers or Beds**: At least 12 inches deep with drainage holes.
- **Soil**: Well-drained, loamy soil or a soilless mix rich in organic matter (pH 6.0-7.0).
- **Support Structures**: Trellises, stakes, or netting (4-6 feet tall).
- **Lighting**: Full-spectrum LED grow lights (if natural light is insufficient).
- **Watering System**: Drip irrigation or a watering can for consistent moisture.
- **Fertilizer**: Balanced (e.g., 5-10-10) or organic options like compost or manure.
- **Ventilation**: Fans or vents for air circulation.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Thermometer, hygrometer, and pH tester.
- **Pest Control**: Neem oil, insecticidal soap, or row covers.
- **Harvesting Tools**: Scissors or hands for gentle picking.

## 2. Choosing the Right Pea Variety

Selecting the right variety ensures success in your grow room:
- **Shelling Peas**: Grown for the peas inside (e.g., 'Green Arrow').
- **Snap Peas**: Edible pods and peas (e.g., 'Sugar Snap').
- **Snow Peas**: Flat, edible pods (e.g., 'Oregon Sugar Pod').

For limited space, opt for dwarf varieties like 'Little Marvel' or 'Tom Thumb'. Check seed packets for growth habits and days to maturity (typically 60-70 days).

## 3. Setting Up Your Grow Room

A well-designed grow room maximizes pea growth:
- **Space**: Allow 4-6 feet of vertical space for climbing vines. Space plants 2-3 inches apart in rows 18-24 inches apart.
- **Containers**: Use pots or raised beds at least 12 inches deep with good drainage.
- **Ventilation**: Install fans to maintain airflow and prevent heat buildup.
- **Layout**: Arrange containers or beds to optimize light exposure and access for maintenance.

## 4. Optimal Growing Conditions

Peas thrive under specific conditions:
- **Temperature**: 55°F to 75°F (13°C to 24°C). Use heaters or cooling systems to maintain this range.
- **Humidity**: 50-70%. Use a dehumidifier if levels exceed this to prevent mold.
- **Soil**: Loamy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0-7.0. Add compost for fertility.
- **Lighting**:
  - **Natural Light**: At least 6 hours of direct sunlight (south-facing window).
  - **Artificial Light**: Full-spectrum LEDs, 12-18 inches above plants, on for 12-16 hours daily.
- **Air Circulation**: Use oscillating fans to strengthen stems and reduce disease risk.

## 5. Planting and Germination

Proper planting sets the stage for healthy plants:
- **Seed Prep**: Soak seeds in water for 12-24 hours to boost germination.
- **Planting**: Sow seeds 1-2 inches deep and 2-3 inches apart.
- **Germination**:
  - Keep soil moist but not soggy.
  - Maintain 60-70°F (15-21°C) for 5-10 days until sprouts emerge.
  - Thin seedlings to 2-3 inches apart if overcrowded.

## 6. Watering and Feeding

Consistent care ensures robust growth:
- **Watering**:
  - Keep soil evenly moist, especially during flowering and pod development.
  - Use drip irrigation or water at the base to avoid wet leaves.
  - Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.
- **Feeding**:
  - Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 5-10-10) at planting.
  - Side-dress with compost or manure when vines begin to climb.
  - Avoid excess nitrogen, as peas fix their own from the air.

## 7. Providing Support for Climbing

Peas need support to grow upward:
- **Structures**: Install trellises, stakes, or netting (4-6 feet tall) at planting.
- **Training**: Gently guide vines onto supports as they grow; tendrils will cling naturally.

## 8. Pest and Disease Management

Protect your peas from common threats:
- **Pests**:
  - **Aphids**: Spray with insecticidal soap or introduce ladybugs.
  - **Pea Weevils**: Use row covers or handpick.
  - **Spider Mites**: Increase humidity and apply neem oil.
- **Diseases**:
  - **Powdery Mildew**: Improve air circulation; use fungicide if needed.
  - **Root Rot**: Ensure proper drainage and avoid overwatering.
- **Prevention**: Inspect plants weekly, rotate crops annually, and keep the grow room clean.

## 9. Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular checks keep plants healthy:
- **Nutrient Signs**:
  - Yellow leaves: Possible nitrogen deficiency; adjust fertilizer.
  - Stunted growth: Increase phosphorus with a balanced feed.
- **Watering**: Check soil moisture daily; adjust based on temperature and humidity.
- **Pruning**: Remove dead or diseased leaves.
- **Lighting**: Raise lights as plants grow to maintain 12-18 inches distance.

## 10. Harvesting Your Peas

Harvest at the right time for peak flavor:
- **Timing**:
  - **Shelling Peas**: Pods are plump, peas fully developed (60-70 days).
  - **Snap Peas**: Pods are crisp, peas visible but not mature.
  - **Snow Peas**: Pods are flat, peas just forming.
- **Method**: Hold vine with one hand, pull pod with the other. Harvest regularly to boost production.
- **Best Time**: Morning, when peas are crisp and moist.

## 11. Storing Your Harvest

Preserve freshness after picking:
- **Short-Term**: Refrigerate in a perforated bag for up to 1 week.
- **Long-Term**:
  - **Freezing**: Blanch for 1-2 minutes, then freeze for up to 12 months.
  - **Canning**: Use a tested recipe for up to 1 year storage.
- **Tip**: Use peas soon after harvest for best taste.

## 12. Troubleshooting Common Issues

Resolve problems quickly with these solutions:

| **Issue**               | **Possible Cause**             | **Solution**                                |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Poor Germination        | Old seeds, wrong temperature   | Use fresh seeds, keep soil at 60-70°F.      |
| Yellowing Leaves        | Nitrogen deficiency, overwatering | Adjust fertilizer, check drainage.       |
| Leggy Stems             | Insufficient light             | Increase light duration or intensity.       |
| No Pods                 | Heat, poor pollination         | Keep below 75°F, hand-pollinate if needed.  |
| Tough Pods              | Harvested too late             | Pick earlier when tender.                   |
| Pest Infestation        | Poor airflow, lack of checks   | Improve ventilation, use organic controls.  |
| Wilting                 | Underwatering or root rot      | Check soil moisture and drainage.           |
